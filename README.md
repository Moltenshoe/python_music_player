# Harmony Player

This is a simple desktop music player built using Python, PyQt5 for the GUI, and Pygame for audio playback.

It was created as part of a mini project while I'm learning Python and GUI development. My goal with this project was to understand how to build real desktop applications and improve step by step on my journey to become a better developer.

## Features

- Custom GUI layout
- Play, pause, next, and previous buttons
- Add a folder of music files to play (.mp3, .wav, .flac, .ogg)
- Shows current song title and artist

## Known Issues

## About

This is just one small step in my learning journey. I'm still improving, and building small projects like this helps me learn and grow as a developer." > README.md
